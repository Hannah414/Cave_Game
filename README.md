# Cave Game
### Summary
Using Unity's game design platform, I will learn C# while creating a game which allows players to explore caves and engage enemies. The goal of the game will be to reach the exit at the last level. I aim to make the game fully functional, with good graphics and interesting gameplay. 

## Week 1 - 9/4/23

Decided on a top down view for the game 

Looked over different sites to find sprites 

Watched first few tutorials on Unity basics 

## Week 2 - 9/11/23

## Week 3 - 9/18/23

Wrote script for character movement 

Finished background for first level

## Week 4 - 9/25/23

Found a character to use 

Created character animations for idle and walking 

Decided that movement between levels would involve passing through a doorway at right side of level then having a cut animation which opens to next level

## Week 5 - 10/2/23

Attached animations for character idle and walking movement 

Created edges of level and prevented character from moving outside confines of level

Need to work on padding of collision as character can get closer to edge when going down then when going any other direction

## Week 6 - 10/9/23

Created collectable item (sword) 

Reworked player movement to better suit need for collectables and collisions 

Learned more about using box collider

THE ATTACK ERROR IS FIXED!!!!!

## Week 13 - 11/27/23
