# Cave Game
### Summary
Using Unity's game design platform, I will learn C# while creating a game which allows players to explore caves and engage enemies. The goal of the game will be to reach the exit at the last level. I aim to make the game fully functional, with good graphics and interesting gameplay. 

## Week 1 - 9/4/23

Decided on a top down view for the game 

Looked over different sites to find sprites 

Watched first few tutorials on Unity basics 

## Week 2 - 9/11/23

Started looking for background and character sprites to use for game 

Found a background that worked well for the theme 

## Week 3 - 9/18/23

Wrote script for character movement 

Finished background for first level

## Week 4 - 9/25/23

Found a character to use 

Created character animations for idle and walking 

Decided that movement between levels would involve passing through a doorway at right side of level then having a cut animation which opens to next level

## Week 5 - 10/2/23

Attached animations for character idle and walking movement 

Created edges of level and prevented character from moving outside confines of level

Need to work on padding of collision as character can get closer to edge when going down then when going any other direction

## Week 6 - 10/9/23

Created collectable item (sword) 

Reworked player movement to better suit need for collectables and collisions 

Learned more about using box collider

## Week 7 - 10/16/23

Added second level

Corrected collisions to account for only bottom half of player

Created passway between the two levels 

Created basic animations for skeleton sprite (considering finding new sprite)

## Week 8 - 10/23/23

Made basic outlines for levels 1-7

Added animations for character attacks, but only if sword was collected

Added color overlay when characters/enemies were hurt

Made enemy disappear when they die

Added basic health to character/enemies 

Corrected coding for camera

## Week 9 - 10/30/23

Created basic animations for goblin

Found npc - crazy old man (Hermin?)

Added death when walking in lava 

Added in sprites for chests/boxes/barrels

## Week 10 - 11/6/23

Prepared outline for revamp of scripts for character

Started research on knockback

Researched how to use functions between separate C# scripts

## Week 11 - 11/13/23

Added range to enemy script

Combined player movement and player attack 

Finished filling in new scripts planned in week 10

Fixed all errors appearing in console

Fixed player/enemy overlap

## Week 12 - 11/20/23 (Thanksgiving)

DEAR GOD THE ATTACK ERROR IS FIXED!!!!! 

Can hit and destroy crates (large crates = 2 hits, small = 1 hit)

Enemy does not push player 

Added all crates

Included new enemy type: Goblin

## Week 13 - 11/27/23

Created separate scripts for crates

Started on new scripts for multiple collectable items 

Weird error with List type not functioning?

Readded enemy damage (still need to test, canâ€™t because of list error)

Started new syllabus for next semester

## Week 14 - 12/4/23

Fixed issue with Right slice animation (was reversed?? lol)

Made attack range smaller 

Added end screen for player 

Enemies now damage player 

Enemies play attack animation when attacking (needs tuning) 

Made the game downloadable
